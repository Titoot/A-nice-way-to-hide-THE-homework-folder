# A-nice-way-to-hide-THE-homework-folder
a little funny console program i made!


## What it does
easy!
- at first you enter a code and the your password (you need to edit these from the code the default code is '177013')
- then it starts reading hardisks and flash drives connected to the pc 
- then you plug your USB (you need to change the name if it in the code too!)
- and it scans for a txt file in that flash drive (default it's named "note", you can change it)
- then in that note it scans for certain word (mine is "FlatIsJustice")
- and boom after it confirms that it opens the secret directiory (For example the Hentai folder [you need to change the directory location!])
